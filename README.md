What is the Pitch? 
  The Pitch it meant to be an application to sort and filter scripts from screenwriters. This app has no established algorithm, 
and is meant to give every script a fair shot at getting seen. 

The Pitch allows screenwriters, producers, and directors to post scripts, discover new pieces of work, and
 collaborate with others. Users can create an account, log into an existing account, or browse as a guest. 
 After choosing their role (screenwriter, producer, or director), they have the option to explore. 
 Screenwriters can pitch a script idea, browse for collaborators, and browse for ideas. 
 Producers can search for scripts, browse for collaborators, and browse for directors. 
 Finally, directors can search for scripts, browse for collaborators, and browse for producers. 

We used Python, Tkinter, and SQL to create our app.
